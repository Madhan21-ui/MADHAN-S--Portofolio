    <p>The Smart IoT-Based Assistive Navigation System for the Visually Impaired is an innovative solution designed to enhance the mobility and safety of individuals with visual impairments. Traditional mobility aids such as walking canes provide limited assistance and require constant manual navigation. This project integrates advanced IoT and sensor-based technologies to provide real-time guidance, ensuring a safer and more independent navigation experience. The system is built using a NodeMCU microcontroller, which processes data from various sensors and provides instant feedback to the user, helping them detect and avoid obstacles in their surroundings.

    <br><p>One of the core features of this system is the ultrasonic sensor, which detects obstacles in the userâ€™s path. Upon detecting an obstacle, the system activates a vibration motor, providing haptic feedback to alert the user. This hands-free approach allows visually impaired individuals to navigate unfamiliar environments more confidently. Additionally, the system incorporates an accelerometer sensor, which detects sudden falls. If a fall is detected, the system triggers a buzzer alert to notify nearby individuals and uploads an emergency alert to the ThingSpeak server, ensuring that caregivers or medical professionals can provide immediate assistance.</p>
